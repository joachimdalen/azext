# Changelog Generation

The `changelog generate` command generates a new changelog file.

## Example

Even though this project is not an extension for Azure DevOps, we still use azext for changelog generation.

Here are our files that are used for changelog generation.

- [Changelog configuration](./)
- [Generated changelog](./)
- [Generated cache](./)
